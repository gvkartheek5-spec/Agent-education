# Education support for poor children
1. 📝 Problem Statement

Many poor children cannot access quality education because of:

Low family income

Lack of learning materials

High dropout rates

No awareness about the importance of education

Poor school access in rural/slum areas


Goal:
Build an AI Agent that analyzes educational and poverty-related data and provides insights for NGOs and governments to improve educational support.


# 🤖 Why AI Agents? (Simple Explanation)

Traditional programs = fixed output.
AI Agents = smart assistants that can:

Understand natural language

Use tools (code functions) to analyze data

Generate charts, summaries, insights

Help decision-makers understand where help is needed

Automate reporting and planning


So instead of manually analyzing data, the AI agent can:

> “Find regions with highest dropout rate”,
“Suggest improvements”,
“Plot comparison”,
“Give recommendations”.

# 🧩 Tools the Agent Can Use

We provide the agent with abilities (called “tools”), such as:

Load dataset

Describe dataset

Find high-risk regions

Plot dropout rates

Give suggestions


Agents use tools automatically when needed.

# 🏗 How We Create It — Step-by-Step

Step 1: Create a dataset (dummy educational data)

Step 2: Create tools (functions for analysis)

Step 3: Build the AI Agent and connect the tools

Step 4: Ask the agent questions (demo)

5. 🧪 Full Working Code Example (Simple & Clean)

👉 Step 1: Create sample dataset

# create_dataset.py
import pandas as pd

data = {
    "Region": ["Urban", "Urban", "Rural", "Rural", "Slum", "Slum"],
    "Family_Income": [7000, 5000, 2000, 1500, 1000, 1200],
    "School_Access": ["High", "Medium", "Low", "Low", "Very Low", "Very Low"],
    "Dropout_Rate": [5, 12, 25, 30, 35, 40],
    "Literacy_Rate": [88, 75, 55, 50, 42, 28]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.to_csv("education_poverty.csv", index=False)


---

👉 Step 2: Tools for the AI Agent

# tools.py
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def load_data():
    return pd.read_csv("education_poverty.csv")

def summary(df):
    return df.describe(include='all')

def high_dropout(df):
    return df[df["Dropout_Rate"] > 20]

def plot_dropout(df):
    df.plot(x="Region", y="Dropout_Rate", kind="bar")
    plt.title("Dropout Rate Across Regions")
    plt.show()

def suggestions():
    return """
1. Provide free uniforms and books in rural/slum areas.
2. Start midday meal programs to increase attendance.
3. Offer transport support for long-distance students.
4. Create digital learning centers for tribal/rural children.
5. Conduct awareness programs for parents on education benefits.
"""

👉 Step 3: Create the AI Agent

(This example follows a typical agents framework used in Kaggle / general Python agent libraries.)

# agent.py
from kaggle_ai_agents import Agent
from tools import load_data, summary, high_dropout, plot_dropout, suggestions

df = load_data()

agent = Agent(
    name="EducationSupportAgent",
    instructions="""
    You analyze data about education and poverty.
    Use tools to answer questions and give insights.
    """,
    tools={
        "summary": lambda: summary(df),
        "high_dropout": lambda: high_dropout(df),
        "plot_dropout": lambda: plot_dropout(df),
        "suggestions": lambda: suggestions()
    }
)


---

👉 Step 4: Demo — Ask the Agent Questions

# demo.py
print(agent.send_message("Give me summary of the dataset."))

print(agent.send_message("Which regions have the highest dropout rate?"))

agent.send_message("Plot dropout rate across all regions.")

print(agent.send_message("Give suggestions to improve education for poor children."))


---

6. 📊 Demo Output (Expected)

Summary

Shows stats of family income, dropout rate, literacy rate…

High Dropout Regions

Rural: 25–30%
Slum: 35–40%
These areas need urgent educational support
